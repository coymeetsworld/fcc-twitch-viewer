# Wikipedia Viewer

## Description
This application makes several Twitch API calls to gather and display information on featured streams as well as a hard-coded list of users. A user can click on the stream and it will open up another browser window to the Twitch page. Details of the API can be found [here](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs).
